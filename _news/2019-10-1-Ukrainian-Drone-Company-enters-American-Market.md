Ukrainian entrepreneur and engineer Yuri Pederii, the founder of the AeroDrone (www.aerodrone.biz) start-up that develops industrial grade payload UAVs for crop spraying has formed a cooperation agreement with longtime business associate, the American born finance entrepreneur, Mark Erjavec.

The newly formed Aero Fleet One Corporation has been established specifically to invest into the heavy payload UAV industry and the emerging adaptation of Beyond Visual Line of Sight UAV by identifying, investing into and marketing proven UAV equipment, technology and services that bring value to established industries around the world.

The cooperation agreement gives Aero Fleet One the rights to market and operate AeroDrone technology in North, Central and South America. Through a joint initiative of Aero Fleet One Corporation and the Economic Development Commision of Tioga North Dakota, public demonstrations and outreach events for the Aero Drone DR-20 and DR-60 are planned over the next year.

In Spring-Summer 2018 AeroDrone was a member of Ukrainian business incubator and was awarded 2nd place as the most innovative project for an agricultural purpose. In December 2018, Yuri and his team will head to Israel to introduce their technology for the local market and meet other AgTech start-ups and potential partners.
