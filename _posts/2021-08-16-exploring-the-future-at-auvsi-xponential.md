This week, AFO team and board members based in Denver and Minneapolis are traveling to the great southern city of Atlanta for a major conference focused on all things unmanned. Always considering the big picture, this is part of our efforts to stay familiar with the most recent trends and developments in aviation technology.

It takes more than just an airframe to make an aircraft fly - especially one that relies on advanced computer systems to stay in the air. We're checking out not only drone airframe and flight software companies to see who might be good candidates for responding to our RFP ([download RFP](https://aerofleetone.com/assets/files/RFP-AFO-UAS.pdf)), but also hardware and software companies who provide supporting tools and services to make fleet management a reality.Â 

As urban and rural environments pose different challenges to supporting components and infrastructure for UAS, we're especially keen to see drone companies that have adapted their tech to agricultural areas and flying Beyond Visual Line of Sight.

As we continue to develop plans for tech integration in the long term, we are looking to make connections with the best and brightest the drone world has to offer.
