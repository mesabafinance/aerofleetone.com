Aero Fleet One was born in 2013 when the founder, Mark Erjavec, met a UAS developer named Yuri Pederii. At the time, Yuri was developing the AeroDrone DR-20, a smaller predecessor to his current work with UAVITA. Mark saw potential in the unique fixed-wing, gas-powered drone technology as the pathway to making unmanned aircraft that would one day be able to accomplish the same tasks as manned aircraft. He bought a DR-20 as a way to support Yuri’s work and kept up with the development team’s progress over the years. In this process, he created Aero Fleet One, with a vision to someday have the world’s largest fleet of autonomous drones performing aerial services at superior levels. Much time has passed since then, and Aero Fleet One is grateful to Yuri for his contributions of technology and inspiration, though the companies are no longer associated. Towards the end of 2020, it came time to start making Mark’s dream a reality. Aero Fleet One’s core team was brought together to get it into place.
