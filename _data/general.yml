      text: >
        Aero Fleet One was born in 2013 when the founder, Mark Erjavec, met a UAS developer named 
        Yuri Pederii. At the time, Yuri was developing the AeroDrone DR-20, a smaller predecessor 
        to his current work with UAVITA. Mark saw potential in the unique fixed-wing, gas-powered 
        drone technology as the pathway to making unmanned aircraft that would one day be able to 
        accomplish the same tasks as manned aircraft. He bought a DR-20 as a way to support Yuri’s 
        work and kept up with the development team’s progress over the years. In this process, 
        he created Aero Fleet One, with a vision to someday have the world’s largest fleet of 
        autonomous drones performing aerial services at superior levels. Much time has passed 
        since then, and Aero Fleet One is grateful to Yuri for his contributions of technology 
        and inspiration, though the companies are no longer associated. Towards the end of 2020, 
        it came time to start making Mark’s dream a reality. Aero Fleet One’s core team was brought 
        together to get it into place.

      heading: Our Purpose
      text: >
        We believe that drones are the future of aerial services, and we want to help bring this to 
        fruition. With a big vision like ours, it’s important to start with a narrow focus. 
        We have selected agricultural aviation as the industry on which to focus our efforts 
        as we step into the world of aerial services. Our team has begun the process of 
        acquiring and merging with aerial application businesses. We seek to understand 
        this major industry thoroughly and do the work from the inside before trying to bring 
        new technology to long-standing customers. We will be coming together with applicators 
        across the country to standardize protocols and communications for increased safety and 
        smoother pathways to shared knowledge. When UAS technology is finally ready to match 
        manned aircraft systems, we will be poised and ready to incorporate them into our 
        fleet-family in the most responsible, appropriate, expert way. We also look for ways 
        to support the development of drone technology and infrastructure to help bring 
        about a more autonomous world through conscientious collaboration. We exist 
        to maximize potential and minimize risk for all involved.
