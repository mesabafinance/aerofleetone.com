            text: >-
                Our team has begun the process of acquiring and partnering with aerial application businesses. We are laying the groundwork from the inside before trying to bring outside technology to long-standing clients.
                <br>We are not developing any UAS of our own, but remain agnostic to seek the optimal technology and supporting systems. We will be coming together with applicators across the country to share best practices and standardize communications for increased safety and efficiency. When the unmanned technology is finally ready to match the capabilities of manned aircraft systems, we will be poised and ready to incorporate them into our fleet-family in the most responsible, appropriate, expert way. 
                <br>We also look for ways to support the development of drone technology and infrastructure to help bring about a more autonomous world through conscientious collaboration. We exist to maximize potential and minimize risk for all involved.
