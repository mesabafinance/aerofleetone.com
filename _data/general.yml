            text:
                - After 100 years of helping to feed and clothe the world, we believe that great things are yet to come for the ag aviation industry. As the demand for this work increases, so will the necessity of improved safety and efficiency. This will require more capital investment for training, equipment, maintenance, infrastructure, and insurance.
                - As the industry sees pilot shortages, regulatory constraints, and inevitable technological upgrades, we know that this will be a hard transition for many operators to face. Many aging operators do not have an exit strategy and many young pilots do not have the financial means to begin. We want to see the industry through this season by providing financial stability, creating sustainable infrastructure, and integrating strategic technologies.
                - Our team has begun the process of acquiring and partnering with aerial application businesses. We will be coming together with applicators across the Americas to share best practices and standardize communications for increased safety and efficiency. We will also continue to implement the best technologies available across our operations. We are here to help the agricultural aviation industry survive - and thrive - through the next waves of global demand and technological advancement.
