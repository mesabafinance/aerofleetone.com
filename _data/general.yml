    title: A Letter From Mark M. Erjavec
    text: >-
      My career and business success includes the experiences of being a first mover. I and the colleagues I surround myself with demonstrate keen ability to identify feasible pathways to success. I have learned that the leading agricultural players, many of whom I nurture relations, value transparency and therefore I make it a hallmark of my relationship building. In developing relationships my goal is to make a market for others by forging a business model that attracts capital investment from the world’s agricultural investors. Because assets can react differently to the same economic event, investment diversity will ensure ongoing success.<br><br>
      My investments are done through Mesaba Finance Company Incorporated, which supports a boutique investment banking operation and employs international staff to manage funds related to agriculture and other specialty finance in North, Central and South America, as well as a project in the Horn of Africa.
